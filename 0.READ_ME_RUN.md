# Installation

## Install building tools
   - **example for Ubuntu in some VM or in WSL on Windows run:**
       - sudo apt update
       - sudo apt upgrade
       - sudo apt install binutils    //to have utils like archive tool (ar), etc.
       - sudo apt install g++         //C++ compiler
       - sudo apt install make
       - sudo apt install python3
       - sudo apt install openjdk-11-jdk    //instal jdk 11 and not the most recent version
       - java --version // to confirm the jdk default jdk version
   
   - **example for Windows:**     
       - download and install "Build Tools for Visual Studio": 
         - na instalação selecionar c++ e build tools
       - download and install python 3 
       - download and install jdk 11 (or install after through intellij)
     

## Download Project
   - inside ubuntu, or inside some folder in WSL, or directly in Windows: 
   
         git clone https://github.com/fmssilva/automate_verifx

## Z3 Solver
  - We use the Z3 solver to run the proofs 
  - download the most up-to-date version available in assets in:
    - https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3/releases
  - download src code, extract to some folder, "cd" to that Z3 folder
  - compile:
      - python3 scripts/mk_make.py -x --java
        - -x to create 64 bits linking files
          - if with -x it gives error, just install the Z3 without it, with 32 bits. Then when running the proofs in intellij it will give an error:  "Can't load IA 32-bit .dll on a AMD 64-bit platform", so then go to the Z3 again in git and download the corresponding version ex: z3-4.13.0-x64-win.zip, and then just copy the files libz3 e libz3java from z3/bin to the root folder of the project
        - --java to create the lib3java.so file
      - cd build
      - make // on linux
        - nmake // windows » open a terminal for "Developer Command Prompt" (this is not a normal terminal, nor even the administrator mode terminal. you should search for it in windows); that terminal will open normally in "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\BuildTools>" so then do cd to the folder you have the Z3 
      - confirm in build if the files lib3 and lib3java were produced and copy them to the root folder of the project (replace the existing files there - and each SO will have different linking files like .so, .dll, .lib, etc. )
      - in linux, at the end of make there should be the warning: Z3Py scripts can already be executed in the 'build/python' directory. Z3Py scripts stored in arbitrary directories can be executed if the 'build/python' directory is added to the PYTHONPATH environment variable and the 'build' directory is added to the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable.
        - just install Z3 globally with:
          - sudo make install 
  - more on Z3 installation in:
    - https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3


## Intellij - RUN PROGRAM
- open project
  - if in WSL: close current project to go to initial pannel; click Remote dev » WSL; open project from the folder in WSL


- **Confirm the AntidoteSQL Commands**
    - In Folder: AntidoteSQL_Data, in file input.txt
      write the commands to create tables
    - In READ_ME_AntidoteSQL find the currently implemented rules for the commands


- **Generate the VeriFx code**
    - delete the folders:
        - generatedSysTables in src/main/verifx
        - generatedSysTablesProofs in src/test/scala
    - run the program in AntidoteSQL_To_VeriFx in src/main/scala: 
        - the program will create the deleted packages again, now for the given AntidoteSQL input
        - first time opening a scala doc it will ask to install the scala and sbt builder
          - sbt - Simple Build Tool - is the building tool for scala projects, like maven or gradle... 
    - check if the classes were generated correctly:
        - in src/main/verifx/generatedSysTables, check if the classes were created for the tables given in input.txt
        - in src/test/scala, check if the proofs were created for the tables given in input.txt

- **Run the Proofs**
    - open the files in src/test/scala/generatedSysTablesProofs and run the proofs
      - start with the first proof "is_a_CvRDT" to check if the Z3 works
    - if errors because of the version of jdk, so select the version 11:
          - file » proj strucute » sdk » choose jdk 11 
            - (if working remotely on WSL so chose the jdk 11 installed there)
  

- **Configure Intllij to recognize veriFx code**
  - as described in the end of the read me of:
        https://github.com/verifx-prover/verifx
