# HOW TO RUN PROGRAM

1. **Give the AntidoteSQL Commands**
   - In Folder: AntidoteSQL_Data, in file input.txt
        write the commands to create tables 
   - In READ_ME_AntidoteSQL find the currently implemented rules for the commands 

2. **Generate the VeriFx code**
    - in src/main/scala run: AntidoteSQL_To_VeriFx 
    - it will create: 
      - in src/main/verifx:
        - "systemTables" package, with all the packages and classes created in the input.txt
      - in src/test/scala:
        - "systemTablesProofs" with the classes with the Proofs for each table 

3. **Run the Proofs**
   - open the files in src/test/scala/systemTablesProofs and run the proofs 




# Installation
## In Linux (Or in Windows, using Linux):
1. **Create a VM or install WSL in windows with ubuntu for example**

3. **Install necessary tools in ubuntu:**
   

    sudo apt update
    sudo apt upgrade
    sudo apt install binutils    //to have utils like archive tool (ar), etc.
    sudo apt install g++         //C++ compiler
    sudo apt install make
    sudo apt install python3
    sudo apt install openjdk-11-jdk    //instal jdk 11 and not the most recent version
    java --version // to confirm the jdk default jdk version

4. **Download Project**
   - in the folder we want, inside WSL make a clone:
   
         git clone https://github.com/fmssilva/automate_verifx

4. **Z3**
    - We use the Z3 solver to run the proofs 
    - download version 4.11.3.0  (to match the version used internally by verifx) 
    - download src code, extract to some folder, "cd" to Z3 folder
    - compile:


        python3 scripts/mk_make.py --java <br>
            (--java to force the creation of lib3java.so file)<br>
        cd build<br>
        make<br>
        » confirm in build if the files lib3 and lib3java were produced<br>
            and copy them to the root forder of the project (replace the existing files there)<br>
        » in the end of make there should be the error message:<br> 
            Z3Py scripts can already be executed in the 'build/python' directory.<br>
            Z3Py scripts stored in arbitrary directories can be executed if the 'build/python' directory is added to the PYTHONPATH environment variable and the 'build' directory is added to the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable.<br>
            Use the following command to install Z3 at prefix /usr. sudo make install<br>
        » So install Z3 globally:<br>
            sudo make install<br>


5. **Intellij**
    - if in WSL: 
      - close current project to go to initial pannel
      - click Remote dev » WSL
      - open project from the folder in WSL
      - accept pop ups that show up like 
        - Microsoft Defender exclusion list - add to path automatically... 
      - open  "src/main/scala/AntidoteSQL_To_VeriFx" 
        - accept the scala pop up, and it will install scala and sbt builder
          - sbt - Simple Build Tool - is the building tool for scala projects, like maven or gradle... 
        - run the program AntidoteSQL_To_VeriFx to check if the classes are generated as described above
      - open src/test/scala/systemTablesTests and run the first proof "is_a_CvRDT" to check if the Z3 works 
      - open a verifx class and configure intellij to recognise those files, as described in the end of the read me of:
         https://github.com/verifx-prover/verifx
      - if multiple jdk might be available, select the version 11: 
        - file » proj strucute » sdk » choose jdk 11 installed in WSL or ubuntu
